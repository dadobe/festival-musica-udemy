<!-- ABOUT ME -->

## About Me

Hello there! I'm 'dadobe'.

Starting a new journey in WEB DEV. Trying to learn a bit everyday. Finally decided to put in practice what I've learned in the past months.

This is a simple example of a responsevly web page for a Music Festival.

All credits for this go to the Instructor of the Web Dev course [Juan Pablo De la torre Valdez](https://www.udemy.com/user/juanpablodelatorrevaldez/) from the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) learning platform.

## Info

Cool project on which you can smoothly scroll to the different sections of the web (top, gallery & tickets).
The page is completely responsive :) (looks quite cool when you manage to make it work in that way!!).
In this project I learned how to create a project using [SASS](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass), which is basically to split your CSS in little files to make it easier to work with.
Also learned to work with [GULP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulp.js).
I also learned how to manipulated [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) in order to make a WEB more interactive.

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?vfquery=serif&query=pop&preview.text=The%20creative%20crew&preview.text_type=custom) as well in order to match as best as possible with the example given.
